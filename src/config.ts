 * Everything the bridge reads from its environment, read once at start.

 * for features it does not have is a skeleton whose operator believes those
 * features are on; the platform's URL and credential are added by the task that
 * first needs them (4.1), with the code that consumes them.
 *
 * A malformed value throws rather than falling back: a bridge quietly listening
 * on a different port than the device was told is a bridge nobody can find.
